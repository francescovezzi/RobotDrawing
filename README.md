# Drawing Robot Arm

This repository contains Mathematica code to make a robotics arm performing a draw on canvas through kinematic planning and control of end-effector position and orientation.

The orientation reference has been parameterized through **quaternions** and the orientation error has been described as its **vectorial part**.
